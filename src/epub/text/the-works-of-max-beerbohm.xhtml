				<h3 epub:type="title">Preface</h3>
				<p>After some considerable experience in the field of bibliography I cannot plead as palliation for any imperfections that may be discovered in this, that it is the work of a ’prentice hand. Difficult as I found my self-imposed task in the case of the Meredith and Hardy bibliographies, here my labour has been still more herculean.</p>
				<p>It is impossible for one to compile a bibliography of a great man’s works without making it in some sense a biography⁠—and indeed, in the minds of not a few people, I have found a delusion that the one is identical with the other.</p>
				<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Beerbohm, as will be seen from the page headed <a href="../text/the-works-of-max-beerbohm.xhtml#personalia">Personalia</a>, was born in London, August 24, 1872. In searching the files of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Times</i> I naturally looked for other remarkable occurrences on that date. There was only one worth recording. On the day upon which <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Beerbohm was born, there appeared, in the first column of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Times</i>, this announcement:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>“On [Wednesday], the 21st August, at Brighton, the wife of <abbr class="name">V. P.</abbr> Beardsley, <abbr>Esq.</abbr>, of a son.”</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>That the same week should have seen the advent in this world of two such notable reformers as Aubrey Beardsley and Max Beerbohm is a coincidence to which no antiquary has previously drawn attention. Is it possible to overestimate the influence of these two men in the art and literature of the century?</p>
				<p>Like two other great essayists, Addison and Steele, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Beerbohm was educated at Charterhouse, and, like the latter, at Merton College, Oxford. At Charterhouse he is still remembered for his Latin verses, and for the superb gallery of portraits of the masters that he completed during his five years’ sojourn there. There are still extant a few copies of his satire, in Latin elegiacs, called <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Beccerius</i>, privately printed at the suggestion of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> <abbr class="name">A. H.</abbr> Tod, his form-master. The writer has said “Let it lie,” however, and in such a matter the author’s wish should surely be regarded. I have myself been unable to obtain a sight of a copy, but a more fortunate friend has furnished me with a careful description of the opusculum, which I print in its place in the bibliography.</p>
				<p>He matriculated at Merton in 1890, and immediately applied himself to the task he had set before him, namely, a gallery of portraits of the Dons.</p>
				<p>I am aware that he contributed to <i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">The Clown</i> and other undergraduate journals: also that he was a member of the Myrmidons’ Club. It was during his residence at Oxford that his famous treatise on Cosmetics appeared in the pages of an important London Quarterly, sets of which are still occasionally to be found in booksellers’ catalogues at a high price, though the American millionaire collector has made it one of the rarest of finds. These were the days of his youth, the golden age of “decadence.” For is not decadence merely a fin de siècle literary term synonymous with the “sowing his wild oats” of our grandfathers? a phrase still surviving in agricultural districts, according to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Andrew Lang, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Edward Clodd, and other Folk-Lorists.</p>
				<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Beerbohm, of course, was not the only writer of his period who appeared as the champion of artifice. A contemporary, one Richard Le Gallienne, an eminent Pose Fancier, has committed himself somewhere to the statement that “The bravest men that ever trod this planet have worn corsets.”</p>
				<p>But what is so far away as yesteryear? In 1894, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Beerbohm, in virtue of his “Defence of Cosmetics,” was but a pamphleteer. In 1895 he was the famous historian, for in that year appeared the two earliest of his profound historical studies, The History of the Year 1880, and his work on King George the Fourth. During the growth of these masterpieces, his was a familiar figure in the British Museum and the Record Office, and tradition asserts that the enlargement of the latter building, which took place some time shortly afterwards, was mainly owing to his exertions.</p>
				<p>Attended by his half-brother, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Tree, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Tree and a numerous theatrical suite, he sailed on the 16th of January 1895, for America, with a view, it is said, to establishing a monarchy in that land. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Beerbohm does not appear to have succeeded in this project, though he was interviewed in many of the newspapers of the States. He returned, <i xml:lang="la">re infecta</i>, to the land of his birth, three months later.</p>
				<p>After that he devoted himself to the completion of his lifework, here set forth.</p>
				<p>The materials for this collection were drawn, with the courteous acquiescence of various publishers, from <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">The Pageant</i>, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">The Savoy</i>, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">The Chap Book</i>, and <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">The Yellow Book</i>. Internal evidence shows that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Beerbohm took fragments of his writings from <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">Vanity</i> (of New York) and <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">The Unicorn</i>, that he might inlay them in the First Essay, of whose scheme they are really a part. The Third Essay he rewrote. The rest he carefully revised, and to some he gave new names.</p>
				<p>Although it was my privilege on one occasion to meet <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Beerbohm⁠—at five-o’clock tea⁠—when advancing years, powerless to rob him of one shade of his wonderful urbanity, had nevertheless imprinted evidence of their flight in the pathetic stoop, and the low melancholy voice of one who, though resigned, yet yearns for the happier past, I feel that too precise a description of his personal appearance would savour of impertinence. The curious, on this point, I must refer to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Sickert’s and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Rothenstein’s portraits, which I hear that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lionel Cust is desirous of acquiring for the National Portrait Gallery.</p>
				<p>It is needless to say that this bibliography has been a labour of love, and that any further information readers may care to send me will be gladly incorporated in future editions.</p>
				<p>I must here express my indebtedness to <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Garnett, <abbr>C.B.</abbr>, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bernard Quaritch, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Clement <abbr class="name">K.</abbr> Shorter, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> <abbr class="name">L. F.</abbr> Austin, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> <abbr class="name">J. M.</abbr> Bullock, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lewis Hind, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <abbr class="name">H.</abbr> Beerbohm Tree, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Leverson, and Miss Grace Conover, without whose assistance my work would have been far more arduous.</p>
